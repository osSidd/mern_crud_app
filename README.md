# Blog App using MERN stack

This is the solution to task CRUD operations using MERN stack


## Overview
This is a simple blog app made using the MERN stack for demonstrating CRUD operations.

Here the user can add a new blog, delete existing blogs, update the contents of a particular blog and view all blogs in the database.

The repo has two separate folders backend (houses the backend code) and client (contains the frontend code)

Only functionality needed for demonstrating CRUD operations have been provided, to elaborate error handling, form validation, loading components etc functionalities have not been provided.

cd backend
npm install

To start the server
npm start
